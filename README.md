# LogicCircuitSolver
The following zip file contains a C++ program that will solve any logic circuit equation you write.  

This program supports the following logic gates
1) AND gate
2) OR gate
3) NOR gate
4) NAND gate
5) XOR gate
6) NOT gate

   ALL GATES ARE 2 IMPUT GATES

The program supports several error cases:
1) if you enter wrong logic gate name (ANDS, ORA ,etc...), you will receive an error message
2) if you enter wrong number of inputs
3) more errors will be supported soon.
